SHUTDOWN RESTART

shutdown -r 			— restarts  (you have one minute)
shutdown -s 			— shutsdown
shutdown -l 			— logoff
shutdown -s(or -r) -t xx 	- where xx is number of seconds to wait till shutdown/restart/logoff

shutdown -a 			— aborts the previous shutdown command
shutdown -h 			— hibernate



Unfortunately no sleep command.
There are work arounds:

1) 

powercfg -h off          #turns hibernation off necessary for the next command to work
rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,1,0   #sleeps

 #if you want to turn hibernation mode back on    powercfg -h on 

2)

psshutdown -d -t 20 (20 seconds before sleep)
psshutdown -d -t 0  (O seconds before sleep)

So besides psshutdown and rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,1,0

there are two other popular methods to access the sleep command from the command prompt


nirmcd standby
